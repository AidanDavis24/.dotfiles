# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.

My dotfiles includes various files the most important for the homework where
bin, etc, and nanorc. Bin was used to hold the main setup and clean up scripts 
linux.sh and cleanup.sh. Etc included the .gitignore, makefile, and readme which are all used in the setup process or in the case of this readme to
provide context for the code. Finally nanorc was used for nano syntax highlighting.

## .nanorc
This is my custom .nanorc configuration for Nano.

This makes nano easier by providing custom highlighting on the syntax like echo
$HOME and various other funtions. This script was copied to the home directory so it could be used in all nano sessions for this assignment.



## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

This contains custom bash configurations. For this assignment its main function was 
to source addition configuration files.
